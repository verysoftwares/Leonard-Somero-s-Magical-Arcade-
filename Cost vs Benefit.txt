20 games
    + This is what the game needs to be at a bare minimum: a collection of games.
    - There are issues with TIC-80 compatibility currently.

3D apartment
    + Fun meta level to the game bundle
    + Get to show off my custom 3D renderer
    - Need to learn to properly use Blockbench

Point-n-click scenes
    + Offers an interface for 3D
    + Has funky dialogue
    - Unsure of how to mix 2D and 3D elements.

Diskette stacks
    (Player needs to manage stacks of diskettes where only the top diskette can be picked up at one time.)
    + A natural way of demonstrating computer science concepts to the player
    - Tedious for the player, but it could be made to be amusing with dialogue.

Maitreya
    + Drives the narrative forward.
    - Need someone to record with a green screen.

Cognitohazards
    (What is the copyright status for smile.jpg?)
    + Yay for creepypasta
    - May alienate some players

Visual novel choices
    + Reflection of how thoughts appear
    + Relatable for visual novel fans
    - Gotta write a lot of scripts for different choices, but it's manageable.

Timers
    (There's a timer counting down to Maitreya's next appearance. The player has the option to fast forward and reverse.)
    (Also, there's another timer for when the player will inspect a selected point-and-click interface element, again with reverse and fast forward controls. You have the timer's amount of time to make a selection in the point-and-click interface.)
    + Illustrates the passing of time
    - May be difficult to integrate into gameplay

Hyperbolic time chamber
    (A place where time runs slowly, depicted as another 3D model. You can bring stuff from the apartment here.)
    + Magic
    - Might be tedious to transfer stuff and have it be in two separate places
