Maitreya - the main antagonist in Leonard Somero's Magical Arcade.

Maitreya is a "nihilistic Buddhist". He/she thinks the world is a simulation, just like video games. He/she appears throughout the story as a hallucination in the apartment. 

Maitreya wants to escape this world, much like you would exit a video game when done playing. He/she wants the player to join, but he/she must first get the main character to go outside. 

Throughout the game, Maitreya will present the player with cheat codes for the video games, and the player has a choice of cheating for extra cat paws or not. Maitreya's reasoning for this is that since something's "just" a video game, it's okay to manipulate the experience for your convenience.

He/she speaks in Finnish, with English subtitles. His/her purpose is to drive the game's narrative forward, but in a light-hearted way. He/she acts like a trickster. 

The game opens with a long speech by Maitreya, about the nature of visible vs. imagined things. (See Opening%20Speech.txt)

And the game ends with a lengthy bossfight using Hanafuda cards, where Maitreya shows his/her psychotic side. (See Ending%20Speech.txt)
